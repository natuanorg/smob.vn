                above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the
                following categories of personal information for business
                purposes: identifiers, internet and electronic network activity
                information, characteristics of protected classifications under
                California or U.S. federal law; commercial information;
                approximate geolocation information; audio and visual
                information and other information that we have inferred about
                you or that relates to or is reasonably capable of being
                associated with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not sell your personal information. We do allow our
                advertising partners to collect certain device identifiers and
                electronic network activity via our app to show ads that are
                based on your interests. If you prefer to limit this activity,
                your device may include a feature (such as “Limit Ad Tracking”
                on iOS, or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads
                Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of
                having certain information collected through mobile apps used
                for interest-based advertising purposes.

                    pieces of personal information that we process.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Opt out of “sales” of personal information that may be
                    occurring.

                </li>
                <li>

                provide information that matches information we have on file
                about you. California consumers can also designate an authorized
                agent to exercise these rights on their behalf, but we will
                require proof that the person is authorized to act on their
                behalf and may also still ask them to verify their identity with
                us directly.
